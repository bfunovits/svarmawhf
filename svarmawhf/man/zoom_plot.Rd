\usage{
zoom_plot(p, p0 = p, title = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{p, p0}{two \code{\link{function}} ("closure") objects which produce an R plot
when calling \code{p()}, \code{p(xlim)} and \code{p0()} respectively.
Both plots should use the same range of "x-values".}

\item{title}{(character) optimal title for the "shiny app window"}

\item{...}{not used.}
}
\value{
This function normally does not return; interrupt R to stop the application
(usually by pressing Ctrl+C or Esc).

\description{
The utility \code{zoom_plot} creates and runs a "shiny app" which displays two plots:
Drawing (and dragging) a "brush" in the "control" plot at the bottom zooms into
zooms into the selected x-range of the plot at the top.
}
\details{
This utility is based on the \pkg{shiny} package.
